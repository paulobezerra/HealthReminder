<h1>Privacy Policy - Health Reminder</h1>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> May 17, 2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The "Health Reminder" extension was developed to help users maintain healthy habits by providing reminders to stand up, drink water, and use the bathroom while using the computer. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data.</p>

<h2>2. Data Collected</h2>
<p>The extension collects the following data:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Local Settings:</strong> The reminder interval (in minutes) set by the user is stored locally on the device using the `chrome.storage` API. This data is not sent to external servers.</li>
  <li><strong>Anonymous Analytics Data:</strong> We use Google Analytics 4 (GA4) to collect anonymous usage data, such as events for installation, popup openings, and notification displays. This data does not include personally identifiable information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Use of Data</h2>
<p>The data is used to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Persist your reminder interval settings across sessions.</li>
  <li>Monitor general usage of the extension (via Google Analytics) to improve the user experience and fix issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not share personal data with third parties. Analytics data sent to Google Analytics is anonymous and used solely for statistical purposes.</p>

<h2>5. Security</h2>
<p>Data stored locally (reminder interval) is securely saved on the user's device and is not accessed by third parties.</p>

<h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will always be available on this page.</p>

<h2>7. Contact</h2>
